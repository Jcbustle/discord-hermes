"""The repo's PowerShell scripts must parse — checked with the REAL parser.

install.ps1 is fetched standalone (``irm | iex``) by every Windows user, so
a parse error ships instantly and breaks installs at line 1. Linux CI cannot
execute PowerShell, which is why the other install_ps1 tests are source-regex
probes; this test runs on the ``platforms("windows")`` lane (tests-os.yml), where a
PowerShell host is part of the OS, and asks the actual language parser.

The harness is written to a file and invoked with ``-File`` because inline
``-Command`` needs every ``$`` and quote to survive a shell hop, and
``[ref]$null`` fails inside ``-Command`` with "[ref] cannot be applied to a
variable that does not exist" — an error easy to misread as a finding
against the file under test.
